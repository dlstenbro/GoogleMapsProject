# GoogleMapsProject
Mobile application using Google Maps

* Summary: This is a small project to explore the Google Maps API through Android.

* Goal: To get experience with Android and how to use the Google Maps API

# Features 

1. Display a simple Google map in an android environment 
1. Add functionality to switch between map types
1. "Add Marker" button allows the user to allow multiple markers



# Possible projects with the GoogleMaps API

1. Heat Map to display terrain by soft to dark colors. When a user switches map types, provide a "thermal-like" layout for different elevations. Soft colors are below sea level (blue hints) and dark colors will be extreme elevations (redish hint). The implementation would use a "heat map" where the datapoints are the points in elevation provided by some source.
